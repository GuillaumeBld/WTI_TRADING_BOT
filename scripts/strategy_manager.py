Strategy Manager Module

This module dynamically adjusts the trading strategy based on performance metrics
and past trade outcomes. It monitors key metrics to determine when to switch from
Adaptive Mode to Self-Optimizing Mode and adjusts indicator weighting accordingly.

Performance Metrics:
  - Sharpe Ratio (target ≥ 1.0)
  - Win Rate (target ≥ 55%)
  - Max Drawdown (should not exceed 10%)
  - Trade Count Threshold (switch modes after 30 trades)
  - Operation Days Threshold (switch modes after 7 trading days)

When any of these conditions are met consistently, the manager transitions
to Self-Optimizing Mode and rebalances indicator weights.
